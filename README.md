# Device Fingerprint - Former website

I'm archiving this project.  It was cool when it first came out, but I didn't have time
to maintain and update it.

### <i>Website to view the fingerprint that your browser exposes to third parties.</i>

My site's code is now published here so others can learn from it.  Hopefully, I will also learn
from your feedback.  Use of any portion of the code in commercial tracking systems is not
authorized.  If you test the code, please do so from a private IP or use a blocking
robots.txt.  Clone websites would be bad for my already low search rankings.  :)

Naming in the code: A Device entity represents the information gathered during a single page
load. The website user interface now uses the word "imprint" instead of "device".

Github's issue tracking is available to report problems, make suggestions, or feature requests.
